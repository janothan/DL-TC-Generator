# DL-TC-Generator
Given multiple SPARQL queries defined in [the query directory](/src/main/resources/queries), this simple project
generates a gold standard that can be used for machine learning extensions.

The gold standard is intended to be used with a DBpedia embedding.
For the evaluation, [this framework](https://github.com/janothan/dl-evaluation-framework) can be used.
